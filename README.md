Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. It's okay if features repeat on different apps

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not committing to this idea, but it helps to start brainstorming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.

App ideas:
- a fidget app? something that you can fidget with to destress 
- reslife q/a - students who live on campus can ask questions and get llm-powered answers 
- summer bucketlist app - goal and fun oriented with picture prompts?

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
